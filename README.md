# DecisionMaker
This is a program in javascript, html and css that allows users to input 2 choices and pick one at random. 
I will update it later to take more than 2 choices by asking user how many options they have and asking for those options individually. 
I will also add some sort of an animation like a coin flip.

Created and tested through Atom and will continue to update here.
